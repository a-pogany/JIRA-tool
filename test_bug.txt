Login button doesn't work on Safari iOS. When users click the login button, nothing happens.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Safari on iOS 15+
2. Go to the login page
3. Enter valid email and password
4. Click Login button
5. Nothing happens - no error, button stays idle

Environment: Safari iOS 15-17, happens on all iOS versions
Error in console: "Cannot read property 'submit' of null"
This is blocking iOS users from accessing the platform.
